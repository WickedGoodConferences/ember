      %h3.speaker-detail__header Productive Ember Apps with Ember CLI
      %p
        The nature of how we build web applications is changing. Weâ€™re increasingly moving UI code to the client, with a server-side API for interacting with data. However, server-side frameworks still treat client-side code as an afterthought.
        ember-cli is a new tool that enables you to productively build Ember apps regardless of the server-side technology you are using. This talk showcases the complex parts of building Ember apps and how you can use ember-cli to make your life easier.
