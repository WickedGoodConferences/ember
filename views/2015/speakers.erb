        <h3 class="speaker__talk__title">Compose all the things</h3>
        <p class="t-text">As ember is being used for the foundation of even more ambitious web applications, the appeal of leveraging less code to do more has grown. Keeping composability in mind will allow teams to effectively build their own layers of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; on top of the framework, and build apps high quality and velocity.</p>
        <p class="t-text">In this talk, weâ€™ll dive into composable components, computed property macros and tests to explore how investment in generic code can pay off in terms of high degrees of maintainability, testability and extensibility.</p>

W3C Web Components aims to do this, but it&rsquo;s missing a large part of the story. Graffiti fills in these gaps using HTMLBars, ES6/7++ syntax to let you experience the future, now.

        <h3 class="speaker__talk__title">Build Better Desktop Apps with Ember</h3>
        <p class="t-text">Ember.js describes itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications. But &ldquo;ambitious&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to stop at the boundaries of the web world.</p>
        <p class="t-text">Projects such as NW.js have shown that it was possible to write cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. NW.js goes even further, letting you interact with Node modules directly in the browser. But here&rsquo;s the catch: without proper guards and good code organization, issues can arise quickly, leaving you fighting your way through an environment where Node and browser contexts don&rsquo;t always play well together.</p>
        <p class="t-text">In this talk, we will explore some of the challenges you may face, and how you can overcome them with simple tools and techniques. You don&rsquo;t have to look very far for answers. Ember and Ember CLI provide just the right hooks to make desktop applications a breeze to develop and test.</p>

        <h3 class="speaker__talk__title">Writing code to update our code</h3>
        <p class="t-text">After upgrading Ember we might have times where we start to receive warnings about things that we should update in our code because of deprecations.</p>
        <p class="t-text">We can write scripts with tools like sed or Perl to fix our code but, when we are working with multiple teams and projects, we can see that those scripts start to fail or are not easy to maintain.</p>
        <p class="t-text">In this talk we&rsquo;ll cover a different approach to update our code through direct operations on its abstract syntax tree (AST) using recast and how to distribute our solutions as addons so they can be used by other teams.</p>
        <p class="t-text">Specifically we&rsquo;ll see how AST transform are used for scenarios like:</p>
        <p class="t-text">- Route generation in ember-cli</p>

        <h3 class="speaker__talk__title">Taking Ember Offline</h3>
        <p class="t-text">Millions of web apps are silently suffering and you can help. These web apps are dying because they don&rsquo;t have the means to work offline. You can end the suffering today. Your Ember apps can have a brighter future by using features like Application Cache, offline storage and Service Workers.</p>
        <p class="t-text">In this session we will explore what it takes to build an offline-first Ember app by examining an open source Ember project built to run in locations lacking stable Internet like parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p class="t-text">The advent of JavaScript applications means that we need to make sure we evolve our thinking on how to develop accessible experiences on top of the web platform. Just as we no longer design static visual experiences and instead plan for motion in our applications we also need to spend the same intentionality designing and building experiences for users of assistive technology.</p>

        <p class="t-text">Likely one of the most problematic ambiguities comes from the pair computed properties and observers. Existing ember docs and guides treat these concepts as equal pairs. It is even common for established ember developers to have details of the two confused.</p>
