          %p.detail-info Can you tell the difference between good and bad code? What do you base your judgment on?
          %p.detail-info Over the years, the Ruby community has built a fairly strong notion of “the right way” of writing code. During his thought provoking presentation, Matt will show that things are not simply good vs bad, and that what we call “pretty” code might, in fact, just be lipstick on a pig.

          %p.detail-info By now you probably know that RubyMotion is a new toolchain that lets you use familiar Ruby techniques to develop applications for iOS&#133; but do you know what makes it tick? How is RubyMotion different from toolchains such as PhoneGap or Titanium? What does it mean to say that RubyMotion is implemented "on top of the Objective-C runtime"? And how the heck do I debug RubyMotion anyway?
          %p.detail-info I will attempt to answer these questions, and more, by looking deep into the underpinnings of RubyMotion. Along the way, I'll give a bit of an overview of the history of RubyMotion, and maybe even a glimpse at its future.

Together we'll identify the best open source self-hosted options for agile managment, provisioning, git hosting, error tracking, CI, isolated RVM, metrics, central logging, and security. As a bonus, you'll learn how to automate the setup of all these tools as much as possible without sudo privileges.

          %p.detail-info I was recently invited to take part in a hackathon at the White House, at which I built a ridiculously boss iPhone app using RubyMotion for the We The People petition site. It consumes the soon-to-be-published We The People API and provides an attractive way to browse the various petitions on the site. Very likely, it is the greatest iPhone application ever created.

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk Supercharging ActiveRecord with PostgreSQL
          %p.detail-info You've been able to serialize Ruby objects with ActiveRecord in the past, but the database treats serialized objects as text. PostgreSQL has support for advanced data types, like arrays, hashes and ranges, natively, allowing the database to do the heavy work for you. You can query a table for records that contain an array with a specific element. You can build a reservation system in which the database makes sure that you don't double book a room. All of which happens in the database, preventing you from retrieving extra records and processing them in memory.
          %p.detail-info With Rails 4, ActiveRecord has been supercharged. The PostgreSQL adapter has been extended to support arrays and hashes, and was rewritten to make adding your own types easier than before. There are gems out there that allow you to leverage these datatypes in Rails 3 as well.

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk Bloom: A language for disorderly distributed programming
          %p.detail-info Traditional programming languages use a model of computation where individual instructions are executed in order. However, when building distributed systems this model fails to match the reality of how your application code is actually executed. Bloom is a language which allows programmers to build applications as a series of unordered statements while also providing facilities for imposing a particular ordering of events when necessary.
          %p.detail-info During this talk we will explore building applications in Bud, which is a prototype of Bloom implemented as a domain specific language in Ruby. We will discuss the concepts of logical monotonicity, disorderly collections, the CALM principle which is the root of the Bloom language, and how to use he Bloom language to identify critical sections of your code where a coordiation library should be used to ensure consistency.

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk Towards Tooling; A Look at What is Missing From Our Toolbox
          %p.detail-info You can usually judge the maturity of a programming language ecosystem by the breadth of its tooling. For example, Java has a plethora of IDEs that each, in turn, have many well maintained refactoring and code quality plugins (like FindBugs and PMD). C/C++ is equally well established in this space. Even JavaScript is becoming well represented, with a number of static code analyzers and language supersets (like Dart and TypeScript) aimed at improving tooling in the language. But where is Ruby in all of this? This talk will shed some light on the existing tools available in the Ruby world as well as some new tools just starting to be built out in the areas of static analysis, formal verification, and code quality checking. We will look at what kind of tools the Ruby community is good at building, what kind of tools we are bad at, and most of all, some of the tooling we should be working on to really improve our ecosystem and drive more developers to this wonderful language.

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk Killing Fibonacci
          %p.detail-info Testing is an important part of the development lifecycle of any software solution. It is particularly important in the Ruby community with lots of real and perceived pressure to test first, test often and test fully (or at least 90% coverage, right?). However, there has not been as much focus on the why of testing as a mechanism to encourage good code practices, good design decisions and coverage that is meaningful. This presentation aims to change all that. I will start with a brief overview of ruby testing: the why, what, how, when and where. For the rest of the presentation, I will take the Fibonnaci sequence and deconstruct it via a tongue-in-cheek approach to showcase why Good Testing™ is so much more important than Testing&#133; and why tests should force the developer to think deeper about their code&#133; not just as implementation but as behavior!

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk ActiveRecord is still magical
          %p.detail-info ActiveRecord is complex code and because of complexity it has edge cases. In fact lots of edge cases. We will take a look at a number of ActiveRecord features to see how it works and how to deal with some of the edge cases.
          %p.detail-info We will see how default_scope works. And why method "unscoped" removes default_scope from models but not from associations.
          %p.detail-info Do you know the difference between CollectionProxy and Relation ? Do you know why in a has_many through case "@physician.patients.create!" would work but "@physician.patients.where(active: true).create! would silently fail without creating the association record?

          %p.detail-info You probably use Ruby everyday, so why not use Ruby to automate some common tasks? What if you could spin up an EC2 instance and have it automatically configure your web server, database, users, and more? What if you could effectively capture and replicate your production environments reliably and consistently? What if you could then give developers production-like environments as Virtual Machines, with no additional work? What if you could set up your new laptop with multiple Ruby versions, your favorite software, and even change the desktop background - from a single command? The good news is - you can!
          %p.detail-info Chef is a configuration management and automation tool that solves these problems and many m you'll learn common just how easy it is to capture your infrastructure in Chef. Save time and money by using Chef's Ruby DSL to "define" your laptop.

If you're using Chef, run a single command and all your favorite Applications, Preferences, and even passwords are back in place. And the best part - because Chef is written in Ruby, you get to continue using the language you love!

          %p.detail-info.speaker__talk Naming is Hard!
          %p.detail-info Coming up with a good name is one of the hardest things to do in programming. It's one of the least technical things we do, but it has one of the largest impacts on how understandable our code is. Ruby is a very expressive language, which makes it very suitable to naming things well and thereby making maintenance easier. This talk will go over more than just how to name variables and classes: it will show how to extract and name concepts, processes, and procedures from existing code in order to understand it better.
