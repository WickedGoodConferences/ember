    %h2.detail-title Refactoring Rails Workshop
    %p.detail-info  When met with a tangled code足base, how do you decide what to refactor? How do you know if you're making progress?
    %p.detail-info Blog posts and books can make it look easy. "Here's the synthetic example, now use X scripted transformation." Unfortunately, codebases in the wild do not come with the right refactoring patterns hyperlinked.
    %p.detail-info In this hands 足on workshop, you will be presented with an actual Rails application ripe with code smells, tight coupling, leaky encapsulation, and missing abstractions. It's much more than a code sample, written by a real team of developers under a deadline.
    %p.detail-info We will practice identifying issues, explore strategies to attack them, and put them into practice. This is not a walk足through of every refactoring in the cannon; this is practical application of great techniques. After this workshop you will be armed to attack your own legacy applications.
